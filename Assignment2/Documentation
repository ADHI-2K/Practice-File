**SQL Data Analysis on a Local Database**

For this analysis, I imported data from Kaggle. The first task was to count the total number of records in the dataset. Next, I calculated both the SUM and the AVG of a specific numerical column. Finally, I applied a WHERE condition to filter the data based on a particular value.
